MBOOT bootloader
================

MBOOT is a clone of U-Boot, without lots of it functions. Main features:

* All boot procedure is in single file (but only one board is supported for now
  - the one I have access to)
* Only Linux kernel, only in uImage format, no compression, no RAM disks etc
  (but it can be added easily)
* Smaller and cleaner Makefile. No symlinks, no generated files. It works faster!
* Cleaner code: Network stack, Main loop have their explicit states, main
  booting procedure is in single board-specific file. Easy framework for
  generating kernel commad line
* No that damned relocation

Compile
=======

To build the bootloader one have to type

	export CROSS_COMPILE=<your compiler prefix>
	make -f Makefile.<board>

Known to work with my compiler - gcc version 4.4.5 p1.3, pie-0.4.5 built with
the help of Gentoo crossdev suit.

KNOWN BUGS
==========

* Makefile doesn't like when you remove headers.
* Tones of garbage U-boot code. Most of commands I don't fix have old U-boot
  style of passing arguments and thus will not compile
